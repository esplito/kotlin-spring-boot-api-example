# Kotlin Spring Boot API

In this repository I'm playing around with Kotlin & Spring Boot to get a feel for how it is to develop APIs using those technologies.

I'm initially following [Kotlin's official guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started-spring-boot.html) for setting this up.

## Checklist

I have checklist of things that I want to try. See below.

- [x] Create a RESTful web service with H2 Database 
- [x] Add endpoint for CREATE 
- [x] Add endpoint for READ (fetch all or by id)
- [x] Add endpoint for UPDATE
- [X] Add endpoint for DELETE
- [x] Add error handling (404 Not Found added)
- [ ] Generate Swagger with OpenAPI ðŸš§
- [x] Add unit testing (Testing with Mockk in PokemonService)
- [x] Add integration testing (Testing with SpringBootTest)
- [ ] Explore API mocking in integration tests (when calling external service) ðŸš§
