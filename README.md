# Kotlin Spring Boot API

In this repository I'm playing around with Kotlin & Spring Boot to get a feel for how it is to develop APIs using those technologies.

## Checklist

I have checklist of things that I want to try. See below.

- [ ] Create a RESTful web service with H2 Database 
- [ ] Add endpoint for CREATE 
- [ ] Add endpoint for READ
- [ ] Add endpoint for UPDATE
- [ ] Add endpoint for DELETE
- [ ] Generate Swagger with OpenAPI
- [ ] Add unit testing
- [ ] Add integration testing
- [ ] Explore API mocking in integration tests (when calling external service)
