# Notes

This is were I put my notes if I find something interesting in documentation or while experimenting.

## Kotlin - Syntax

- When prefixing an argument with * you are using the spread operator. Example in the `main()` function: `*args`.

## Run requests locally directly in IntelliJ IDEA

You can create a `requests.http` file (there's an example file of this in the project) and add the requests you want to run.
You get a green "Run" icon next to them.

I followed the [instructions here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-spring-boot-add-db-support.html#add-messages-to-database-via-http-request).

## Learn more about Kotlin

The tutorial ended with a link to a [PDF that can be used for a personal development map when learning Kotlin](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/kotlin/docs/Kotlin_Language_Features_Map.pdf).

## Automated testing

I will look into this tutorial: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-test-using-junit.html
